# DeepBlueCLI-Lab

## Objective
 An incident responder has given you some sample event logs to triage, use DeepBlueCLI to quickly triage Windows Event logs for signs of malicious activity. 

### Skills Learned

- Identify a range of attacks using DeepBlueCLI like:
- User creation
- Users being added to groups
- Password guessing
- Password spraying
- Bloodhound offensive tool usage
- Obfuscated commands
- PowerShell used to download remote files
- Suspicious service creation
- Mimikatz used to dump LSASS.exe for credential collection
- and much more

# Steps

## Our Sr. Analyst wants us to investigate powersploit-system.evtx log for a file that's being downloaded. Running the command .\DeepBlue.ps1 .\evtx\powersploit-system.evtx shows two detections for downloads and provides us with the date.

## If we want to view all the event logs at once we can run this command ./DeepBlue.ps1 .\evtx\* > output.txt. This command will also output all the contents into a .txt file that we can open with a text editor for quick scanning.

## Many open-source offensive tools are stored on GitHub, which means attackers can download them using PowerShell. We can open this .txt file generated by DeepBlueCLI with our text editor and search for "githubusercontent". Searching for this we get 3 matches that we can add to our final report.

## This is just one simple way we can use DeepBlueCLI; however, there are many ways an analyst can utilize this tool. Some include:

- Threat Hunting: Proactively searching Windows event logs for signs of malicious activity.
- Incident Response: Analyzing event logs to assess the scope and impact of security incidents.
- IOC Detection: Identifying known indicators of compromise within event logs.
- Forensic Analysis: Reconstructing timelines and understanding attacker tactics from parsed event data.
- Log Analysis: Parsing and analyzing various Windows event log types for insights into system activity.
- Automation: Integrating into scripts for automating repetitive tasks like IOC scanning.
